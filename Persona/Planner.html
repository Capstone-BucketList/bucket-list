    <h1>The Planner Persona</h1>
        <p>Jackson Browne, a 35 year old Startup Entrepreneur.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Jackson uses and Iphone 16 primarily for business and personal life. Much posting of photos and short videos with
        this phone.</p>
        <p>Jackson utilizes a business-grade Windows Laptop, Dell Latitude.</p>
    <h2>Love/Hate</h2>
        <p>A lover of technology, much of his house runs Smart Devices. A smart tv, smart refridgerator, a Ring
        door bell and even heating/cooling is monitored off his laptop and phone.</p>
        <p>Frustrations come about when his smart devices have upgrading issues that cause his home to have problems;
            such as blowing refridgerated air in winter and much heat in the summer; or Smart TV upgrades with his preferences lost.</p>
        <p>Jackson loves to get away from work and try new experiences. He posts pictures of those experiences on his
            social media accounts. Having Dubai chocolate in a hot air balloon was his last post.</p>
        <p>He doesn't like when a new app appears for the public, and it has bugs running from his phone to the laptop view. </p>
    <h2>Proficiency</h2>
        <p>Moderate User of devices, especially for the smart house and being a planner, Jackson has back up plans
        if his devices fail.</p>
        <p>Jackson prefers a combination of phone and laptop for business meetings, work and also in his personal life. As
        a planner, he finds the mobile of use for quick touch and go needs, and the laptop for full size details on maps,
        weather conditions, videos for smart devices.</p>
        <p></p>
    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
         <p>Jackson follows tech updates towards his smart devices for the home, and comments on video posts on smart devices</p>
         <p>As an Entrepreneur work life is more than Monday-Friday, 8am -5pm. His phone (as a planner) is never below 40% battery
             charge, and he's always available for a work call or video call. </p>
         <p>With work life dominating much, Jackson has a fear of missing out and wants to have more adventures in his life.
         As a planner, Jackson is researching apps for these adventures. </p>

    <h2>User Story</h2>
        <p>As a First Time user, I want to access my bucket list both mobile and on a desk/laptop to post photos of my
        adventures.</p>
    <h2>Use-Case</h2>
         <p>Jackson heard from a Client at a meeting, of this new bucket list app that has great features for sharing your
         bucket list accomplishments and the Client has met some new friends through the app. </p>
    <h3>Precondition</h3>
        <p>Jackson has started an account on this new Bucket List App.</p>
    <h3>Post Condition</h3>
        <p>Jackson has completed one of his Bucket List goals.</p>
    <ul>Interaction Flow:
        <li>Jackson goes through his newly created Bucket List goals.</li>
        <li>App gives a recommendation on completing a goal.</li>
        <li>Jackson considers the recommendation and compares it to his list of items
        he is planning to complete. He explores the App's suggestion</li>
        <li>App notices the user move forward with more information on its' suggestion. The App brings up a timeline,
        and also approaches to take on the goal. </li>
        <li>Jackson considers the timeline, compared to his own thoughts on a timeline. The thoughts parallel each other
        and he decides to take the App's suggestion.</li>
        <li>App provides the steps to Jackson and the timeline of when the goal can be completed.</li>
