    <h1>The Planner Persona</h1>
        <p>Jackson Browne, a 35 year old Startup Entrepreneur.</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Jackson uses and Iphone 16 primarily for business and personal life. Much posting of photos and short videos with
        this phone.</p>
        <p>Jackson utilizes a business-grade Windows Laptop, Dell Latitude.</p>
    <h2>Love/Hate</h2>
        <p>A lover of technology, much of his house runs Smart Devices. A smart tv, smart refridgerator, a Ring
        door bell and even heating/cooling is monitored off his laptop and phone.</p>
        <p>Frustrations come about when his smart devices have upgrading issues that cause his home to have problems;
            such as blowing refridgerated air in winter and much heat in the summer; or Smart TV upgrades with his preferences lost.</p>
        <p>Jackson loves to get away from work and try new experiences. He posts pictures of those experiences on his
            social media accounts. Having Dubai chocolate in a hot air balloon was his last post.</p>
        <p>He doesn't like when a new app appears for the public, and it has bugs running from his phone to the laptop view. </p>
    <h2>Proficiency</h2>
        <p>Moderate User of devices, especially for the smart house and being a planner, Jackson has back up plans
        if his devices fail.</p>
        <p>Jackson prefers a combination of phone and laptop for business meetings, work and also in his personal life. As
        a planner, he finds the mobile of use for quick touch and go needs, and the laptop for full size details on maps,
        weather conditions, videos for smart devices.</p>
        <p></p>
    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
         <p>Jackson follows tech updates towards his smart devices for the home, and comments on video posts on smart devices</p>
         <p>As an Entrepreneur work life is more than Monday-Friday, 8am -5pm. His phone (as a planner) is never below 40% battery
             charge, and he's always available for a work call or video call. </p>
         <p>With work life dominating much, Jackson has a fear of missing out and wants to have more adventures in his life.
         As a planner, Jackson is researching apps for these adventures. </p>

    <h2>User Story</h2>
        <p>As a First Time user, I want to access my bucket list both mobile and on a desk/laptop to post photos of my
        adventures.</p>
    <h2>Use-Case</h2>
         <p>Jackson heard from a Client at a meeting, of this new bucket list app that has great features for sharing your
         bucket list accomplishments and the Client has met some new friends through the app. </p>
    <h3>Precondition</h3>
        <p>Jackson has started an account on this new Bucket List App. He has gone through an introduction account form with
        providing his username, email address and started filling out an input field of different Bucket List Goals.</p>
    <h3>Post Condition</h3>
        <p>Jackson has uploaded a profile photo of himself and it's of him on a hot air balloon ride.</p>
    <ul>Interaction Flow:
        <li>Jackson goes through his newly created Bucket List goals. He likes the screen view on his mobile and easy
        to scroll down the page to see his extended goals list.</li>
        <li>App notices activity on the goals list and provides a pop text screen 'Do you need assistance with your
        goals to complete?</li>
        <li>Jackson considers the question on the pop up screen and sees a yes and cancel button. He presses the cancel button.
        </li>
        <li>App closes the pop up text box. </li>
        <li>Jackson moves back up from the screen goals list and sees a hamburger button at the top of the mobile screen view
            to access different pages/ links of his account. He clicks on a photo link</li>
        <li>App opens a new page link to the photo posting page of his account. It is currently empty. App mentions that his
        photo gallery is empty and suggests 'Do you want to post a photo?' with a yes and cancel button as options to
            interact with this question, at the top of the empty photo gallery/</li>
        <li>Jackson remembers his last adventure with Dubai Chocolate and a hot air balloon ride. He finds one of his selfies
        in a hot air balloon ride and presses the yes button.</li>
        <li>App then closes the prompt at the top of the page and loads the steps for uploading a photo into Jackson's Bucket List
        Photo Gallery page.</li>
        <li>Jackson goes through step one with opening the relevant photo folder on his mobile to find his Hot Air Ballon selfie.
        He finds the photo and taps the photo to be selected for the next step. On his Bucket List app, there is an upload button
        for his photo. He presses that button.</li>
        <li>App recognizes that the upload button has been pressed and there is a selected 'Hot Air Selfie' photo to be placed into
        the photo gallery. App brings that photo into view in the photo gallery.</li>
        <li>Jackson likes how the photo represents himself and his last adventure. He then moves up to the hamburger links to find
        his profile page.</li>
        <l>App closes the photo gallery and opens his profile page. There is listed his username, name, email address, information
        about me section and profile picture section that is empty. There is an upload button with that profile picture section for him to
        upload a photo.</l>
        <li>Jackson brings his 'Hot Air Selfie' photo into the Upload Photo bar and presses the Upload Photo button.</li>
        <li>App recognizes the upload button is pressed and takes the selected photo from the upload photo input field. App then
        places that photo as the Profile Picture for Jackson's Bucket List Profile Page.</li>
        <li>Jackson sees his selfie photo above his name, on the profile page. He's satisfied with the photo and the completion
        of his Profile Page and adding 1 photo into his photo gallery.</li>
        <li>Jackson closes the app on his mobile.</li>
