<body>
<h1><strong>Persona: The Dreamer Age:18-25</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Maya Torres (representative character)</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>
<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> College student (part-time barista)</p>
<p><strong>Tech Knowledge:</strong> Very high—mobile-first, spends 6+ hours a day on her phone, uses Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and planning apps regularly.<p>

<h1><strong>Overview:</strong></h1>
<p>Maya is full of ambition and curiosity about the world. She constantly sees videos, travel vlogs, and posts about exciting experiences—skydiving, traveling through Europe, learning a new language—and adds them to her mental “someday” list. She thrives on inspiration but struggles with organization. She has dozens of screenshots saved, notes scattered across apps, and Pinterest boards filled with ideas, but no clear system for turning dreams into reality.</p>


<h1><strong>Attitude & Behavior:</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>Loves discovering new adventures and sharing inspirational content with friends.</li>
    <li>Regularly creates vision boards on Pinterest and mood boards for inspiration.</li>
    <li>Enjoys group activities but doesn’t always have people in her circle who share her interests.</li>
    <li>Feels motivated at first but has trouble following through when goals feel too big or far away.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Frustrations & Needs:</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>Feels overwhelmed by too many options—doesn’t know where to begin.</li>
    <li>Wishes there was one place to collect and organize ideas instead of using scattered notes and screenshots.</li>
    <li>Needs bite-sized steps to make big goals achievable (e.g., “Plan first trip abroad → research passport → find affordable flights”).</li>
    <li>Wants a community of like-minded people to encourage her and maybe join in on experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Goals/Learning Needs:</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>Wants to stay motivated by celebrating progress and milestones.</li>
    <li>Hopes to connect with others who are equally adventurous and inspired.</li>
    <li>Wants to build confidence that her dreams aren’t just “someday wishes” but things she can really accomplish.</li>
    <li>Values an app that blends inspiration (ideas, visuals) with practical tools (checklists, reminders, cost estimates).</li>
</ul>



<h1><strong>Use Case</h1></strong>
    <p>Maya (The Dreamer persona)</p>

    <p><strong>Precondition:</strong> Maya has the app installed and is logged in.</p>
    <p><strong>Trigger:</strong> She sees a TikTok video about backpacking Europe and gets inspired.</p>
    <p><strong>Success Outcome:</strong> Maya saves the idea, organizes it into her bucket list, and feels motivated by seeing it broken down into steps.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure Outcome: </strong>  the process is too confusing or lengthy, she might abandon adding the item and go back to just screenshotting.</p>

<h1><strong> User Story (Maya’s voice)</strong></h1>

<p><strong><em>“As I was scrolling through TikTok and saw this amazing video of someone backpacking through Europe. Normally I’d just screenshot it and forget about it, but with this app, I tapped the + button and added it to my bucket list. I gave it a name, dropped in the video link, and the app even suggested first steps like getting a passport and figuring out my budget. Suddenly it didn’t feel so overwhelming. I added a cover photo to make it look inspiring, and I joined a group of other travelers who are planning trips too. Now instead of just dreaming about it, I feel like I have a real plan to make it happen.”</em></strong></p>
