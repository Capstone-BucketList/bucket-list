# Preston Thorne - The Family-Oriented User

## Persona
    Name: Preston Thorne
    Occupation: Financial analyst
    Home Life: Married with 3 kids (ages 3, 6, and 11)

## Profile
* Preston already has a few ideas of experiences he would like to have with his family, but isn't sure how he can track and remember everything he would like to add to their bucket list.

* Preston and his wife have solid, well-paying careers but still like to save money anywhere available to invest in their children's futures. A portion of that savings and extra cash flow is set aside for vacations and other unique experiences on their bucket list.

## Use Case</h2>
* As a power user, I want to track and create memories and mementos of the adventures the family has together and the time spent with family that my children can look back on for years to come.
