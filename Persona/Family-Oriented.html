      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Preston already has a few ideas of experiences he would like to have with his family, but isn't sure how he
          can track and remember all of the things he would like to add to their bucket list.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preston and his wife have solid, well-paying careers but still like to save money anywhere available to
          invest in their children's futures. A portion of that savings and extra cash flow is set aside for
          vacations and other unique experiences on their bucket list.

      <p><em>As a power user, I want to track and create memories and mementos of the adventures the
        family has together and the time spent with family that my children can look back on for years to come.</em></p>
