<body>
<h1><strong>Persona: The Dreamer Age:18-25</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Maya Torres (representative character)</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 21</p>
<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> College student (part-time barista)</p>
<p><strong>Tech Knowledge:</strong> Very high—mobile-first, spends 6+ hours a day on her phone, uses Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and planning apps regularly.<p>

<h1><strong>Overview:</strong></h1>
<p>Maya is full of ambition and curiosity about the world. She constantly sees videos, travel vlogs, and posts about exciting experiences—skydiving, traveling through Europe, learning a new language—and adds them to her mental “someday” list. She thrives on inspiration but struggles with organization. She has dozens of screenshots saved, notes scattered across apps, and Pinterest boards filled with ideas, but no clear system for turning dreams into reality.</p>

    <li>Needs bite-sized steps to make big goals achievable (e.g., “Plan first trip abroad → research passport → find affordable flights”).</li>
    <li>Wants a community of like-minded people to encourage her and maybe join in on experiences.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
